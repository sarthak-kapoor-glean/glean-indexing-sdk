"""Registry of `api_client` import sites that the test mock helpers must patch.

When a connector base class calls `with api_client() as client:`, the `api_client`
symbol it resolves is the one bound at import time in that module. To intercept
those calls, `unittest.mock.patch` must target each connector module's local
`api_client` reference. Adding a new connector base class without registering
its module here means the test helpers will silently fail to mock it.
